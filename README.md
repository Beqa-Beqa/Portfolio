<p>
   Welcome to my portfolio page. This app is made by "React" utilizing TS and
   SASS. It will allow you to discover more about me and see some of my projects as well.
   While the number of projects may not be extensive, I believe they are still worth showcasing.

<h2>If you're interested in initializing the project on your local machine—perhaps to make some personalizations—follow these steps:</h2>
<br/>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beqa-Beqa/Portfolio.git #clone the repository

#After successfull clone run in the terminal following

npm install #installs neccessary dependencies

npm run dev #runs react vite app in development

npm run gulp #if you use sass you need to run this to keep track of style changes

```
<p>While building this project i used sass. The shinobi folder you see is where you can find all variables, utilities etc.</p>
