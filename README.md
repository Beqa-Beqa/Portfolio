<p>
   Welcome to my portfolio page. This app is made by "React" utilizing TS and
   SASS. It will allow you to discover more about me an see some of my projects as well.
   They aren't many and big ones but i think it's still worth mentioning.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>You will encounter in this project the following</h2>
<ul>
   <li>About me</li>
   <li>My skills</li>
   <li>My projects</li>
   <li>And of course the contact information</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you want to initialize the project on your local machine (maybe you would like to make some changes)</h3>

      <ul>
         <li>npm install</li>
         <li>npm run dev</li>
