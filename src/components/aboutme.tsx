        <p className="lh-2 mt-2">
          Hello, I'm Beka Aladashvili, a passionate and ambitious web developer from Georgia. Currently, I'm pursuing my studies at the Informational Technologies faculty at BTU University. My journey into the world of programming started with an innate curiosity, and it was through JavaScript that I discovered my true passion for web development.

        <h4 className="mt-2 fw-600">Experience and projects</h4>
        <p className="lh-2 mt-2">
          My journey in web development is marked by personal projects where I've explored the realms of JS, React, and API integration. One significant achievement was creating a multi-page web application with React, a challenge that taught me valuable lessons about project structure, code organization, and working with libraries. This experience has motivated me to strive for excellence in every project I undertake.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mt-2 fw-600">Interests and beyond code</h4>
        <p className="lh-2 mt-2">
          Beyond the screen, I indulge in various interests, from an invigorating workout routine to exploring the immersive worlds of video games. I find solace in music and occasionally challenge my mind with a game of chess. Moreover, I believe in the power of languages to connect people, and I'm always eager to learn and communicate in different tongues.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mt-2 fw-600">Future goals</h4>
        <p className="lh-2 mt-2">
          Looking ahead, I'm determined to evolve into a full-stack developer. While I aspire to take on roles in frontend development initially, my ultimate goal is to master both the frontend and backend realms. This will enable me to create holistic and seamless experiences for users, from the visual interface to the underlying functionalities.
